The project was written and compiled with the WPILib packages in Eclipse, with the language being c++. As for the code, the annotated version will be available soon on a different page.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### The autonomous program:\r\n\r\n* Overall, there are 5 different PID subsystems, (custom, not prebuilt WPILib) 4 of which are in the autonomous program\r\n* The robot is using custom voids to control exactly what it is doing. That way, everything is clean and ordered, and multiple arguments can be required without a mess.\r\n\r\n### The tele-operated program\r\n\r\n* The program uses a PID loop to change the motor compensation depending on how many crates are on the elevator\r\n* The program was optimized to ensure the least amount of button usage. (ensures ease of control under pressure)\r\n* Features: tank drive and special axis controls\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
